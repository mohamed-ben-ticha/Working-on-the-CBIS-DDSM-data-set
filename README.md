# Working-on-the-CBIS-DDSM-data-set
This project tackles one of the major problems in computer vision which is semantic segmentation, we will be perofrming 2D segmentation to detect breast abnormalities 
We will be working on the CBIS-DDSM data set that you can fin via this link : https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629
You will find two folders in this repo : The data preprocessing contains all the necessary code to get your data ready to go, and the models folder contains the models that have been trained on the data as well as the ensemble learning notebook in which we apllied the voting ensemble learning technique to enhance our segmentation task
